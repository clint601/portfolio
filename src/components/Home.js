        Hello. Welcome to my web page!
        My name is Clint Jackson, and I am a proud graduate of Mississippi Coding Academy. This site will continue to be updated with new projects and everything I’ve been learning along the way.
        During my time at the academy, I gained hands-on experience with
        <span className="main-text text-danger text-bold"> HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MySQL</span>.
        On this page, you’ll get to know a bit about me and explore both the projects I completed during the program and some of my personal projects.
        Thank you for visiting — I hope you enjoy exploring my page!
